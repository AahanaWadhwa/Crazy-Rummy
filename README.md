# Crazy-Rummy

-This game is known as Crazy Rummy.
-The rules are similar to normal rummy
-In addition, the runs can consist of only 3 cards
-The user can submit whenever he/she wants by clicking the button on the right corner or by just pressing the g key
-The user can sort his/her cards bypassing the button on the left bottom.
-The value of each card is from 1-13
-Player wins if:
	 -he has a pure run while the computer doesn't
	 if both have a pure run then the one with an impure run wins
	 if the situation up-till now is the same for both player and computer, the one with lesser points win

Else the game results in a draw

The player can play the game for infinite moves, whenever he feels that he might win, he can submit the cards and the result would be displayed to him.


Hope you like the game!!!
